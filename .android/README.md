This is a keypair that is usually generated by adb (android debug bridge)
`adb keygen adbkey`

You can hardcode it with the above command and fix it to this fingerprint:
```
$ awk '{print $1}' < ~/.android/adbkey.pub|openssl base64 -A -d -a | openssl md5 -c|awk '{print $2}'|tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'
5D:36:FE:BE:B2:56:F4:18:5C:AB:6D:C8:91:E5:01:80
```
